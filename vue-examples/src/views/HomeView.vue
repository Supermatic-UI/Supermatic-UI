  <h1>Supermatic UI</h1>
  <p>
    Supermatic UI is a project to provide a simple way to create web-fronend UI using server driven UI approach and low-code editor to increase productivity of web developers.
  </p>
  <br />


<p>Best use cases for this project are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Internal web applications, like admin panels and dashboards</li>
  <li>Dynamic web applications with complex UI logic controlled by server</li>
  <li>Low-code and no-code applications</li>
</ul>
<br />

<p>
  Supermatic UI comes from abstract idea of composing UI from metadata, it's not a framework, it's a way to create UI with fraemwork agnostic approach. 
</p>
<p>
  For first time it implemented for Vue.js, but it's possible to implement it for any other framework.
